Noro’s Music Mod is a custom soundtrack for Heroes of Might & Magic 3, which replaces most of the game’s original soundtrack with carefully selected royalty free music by Kevin MacLeod. It was created to provide Heroes 3 streamers and content creators with peace of mind following a wave of copyright claims against YouTube videos featuring the original soundtrack, but is available to all who want to try new music in their game.
